MachineLearning

Washington University in St. Louis, Fall 2012
The final project for the class, Middle Cerebral Artery Aneurysm Classification, was a team project to automate the pre-operatory aneurysm classification process.
The machine learning concept we used was random forests, which were particularly suited for our set of data. We wrote the code in C++ for MATLAB via mex files, as well as compared to a native Matlab implementation.
